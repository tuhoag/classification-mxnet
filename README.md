# Training Scripts for MXNet
I implement this project to bring Tensorlow and PyTorch experience to those who are first to MXNet. The script uses a state-of-the-art deep learning model (Resnet) to train classifiers for images. The script is used to detect markers in X-Ray images and the experimental results are published in an academia paper[1]. The full source code of the project is confidential so I only share the training script.
